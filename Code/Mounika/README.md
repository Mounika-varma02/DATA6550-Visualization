DATA6550 – Visualization Ethics Project  

## Dataset
Titanic training dataset (891 passengers)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Accurate Visualizations
1. Survival Rate by Gender (Bar Chart)
   - Used full dataset
   - Calculated mean survival rate
   - Y-axis starts at zero
   - Shows ~74% female vs ~19% male survival

2. Survival Rate by Passenger Class (Bar Chart)
   - Grouped by Pclass
   - Used survival rates instead of counts
   - Proper scaling for fair comparison

## Misleading Visualizations
1. Manipulated Y-Axis
   - Truncated y-axis to exaggerate difference
   - Data stays the same, but how we see it changes.

2. Cherry-Picked Data (First Class Only)
   - Filtered only first-class passengers
   - Does not represent full dataset
   - Makes biased interpretations

## Key Learning
This analysis shows how choices about how to design visualizations, like how to scale the axes and filter out certain data, can have a big impact on how they are understood. For ethical visualization, the data must be clear, properly scaled, and fully represented.
