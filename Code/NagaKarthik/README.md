# DATA6550-Visualization
## Objective

- The goal of this project is to explore the Titanic dataset and understand survival patterns based on gender, passenger class, and other factors. Another key aim is to demonstrate how visualizations can be both accurate and misleading, and highlight ethical practices in data presentation.
## Methods

**Data Source:** Titanic dataset (titanic.csv)

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Process:**
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns.
- Created accurate visualizations to reflect true proportions.
- Created misleading visualizations to demonstrate common pitfalls.
- Documented ethical considerations to guide proper visualization practices.
## Key Findings

**Gender Differences:** Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.

**Passenger Class Impact:** First-class passengers were more likely to survive than second- or third-class.

**Ethical Insight:** Misleading charts—like truncated axes or cherry-picked data—can distort interpretation, so transparency is essential.

**Visual Examples:**

- Accurate visualizations: accurate_survival_by_gender.png, accurate_survival_by_class.png

- Misleading visualizations: misleading_gender_chart.png, misleading_class_chart.png
## Ethical Considerations

In this project, ethical visualization practices were a key focus. All relevant categories were included in each chart to ensure no data was hidden or misrepresented. Axes and scales were carefully maintained to avoid exaggerating differences or misleading viewers. Clear titles, labels, and percentages were provided so that anyone reviewing the charts could accurately interpret the data. Misleading visualizations were intentionally created and clearly marked to demonstrate common pitfalls, highlighting the importance of transparency and honesty in data presentation.
